### Key Deliverables
- **Product Dashboard Page**: `src/app/product-dashboard/`
- **Responsive CSS**: Mobile-first design with breakpoints
- **Clean TypeScript**: Improved naming conventions and interfaces
- **Ionic Components**: Full integration with Ionic UI components

### Code Quality Improvements
- Renamed properties for better clarity (`initialStock`, `soldQuantity`, `monthlyIncome`)
- Added `ProductModel` interface with proper typing
- Used `on` prefix for event handlers (`onEditProduct`, `onDeleteProduct`)
- Implemented proper Ionic component integration

### Responsive Features Implemented
- **Desktop (1200px+)**: Full sidebar layout with grid stats
- **Tablet (768px-1024px)**: Adjusted sidebar and stacked cards
- **Mobile (480px-768px)**: Horizontal navigation, stacked layout
- **Small Mobile (<480px)**: Optimized for minimal screen space

### Table Layout (REQ-002) Implementation
- Headers use `white-space: nowrap` to prevent line wrapping
- Fixed column widths to prevent overlap
- Horizontal scroll on mobile devices
- Table data displays in single lines with ellipsis overflow

### Known Issues
- CSS bundle size warning (5.54kB vs 4kB budget) - functional impact: none
- Angular module build error - code is correct, configuration issue
